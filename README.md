## Hey ðŸ‘‹

We're Making an Object Oriented Discord Api Wrapper for Deno.

### Why?
Why are you making another Api Wrapper when we've `discordeno`?

When we were making a bot using these api wrappers we struggled a lot due to outdated documentation and some weird functions.

### What can This Api Wrapper do right now?

It can:
- Connect to Discord's gateway
- Cache the data to reduce the api requests
- Create Message Components(Modals are left)
- Reply to user's Messages
- Create Embeds
- Access Discord's cdn endpoints.

and many more...

### When will this be completed?

We've no clue when this will be completed but any contributions are welcome.
